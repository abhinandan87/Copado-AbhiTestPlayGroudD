    <subject>Your IHS Markit Customer Care Case {!Case.CaseNumber} - Markit Securities Finance SFTP Details</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

We have been asked to set up a Secure FTP (SFTP/22) connection between Markit Securities Finance (MSF) and your company.

Please can you provide any external IP addresses you will use for SFTP/22 communication to our servers in order for us to open our Firewalls?

You may also need to allow access on your own Firewall.  If this is the case, please make sure you open the required ports to the following IP addresses.

DNS Name: sftp.sf.ihsmarkit.com
PROD and DR IP Address: 170.207.33.138 and 170.207.35.138

Once we have this information, the MSF Technical Support team will create a user account for you to access our SFTP server sftp.msf.markit.com and contact you with your username/password.

Your SFTP scripts, if possible, should refer to DNS names to allow for automated failover in any planned or unplanned DR situation.

If you require any technical assistance, please do not hesitate to  contact us.

Kind regards,
{!Case.OwnerFullName}
