    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for contacting Customer Care at IHS Markit.

Your Markit Hub account was locked due to multiple invalid log in attempts. We have now unlocked your account successfully.

Please ensure you delete your cookies, history and cache before resetting your password. Avoid using auto-fill functionality and instead manually type your username.
