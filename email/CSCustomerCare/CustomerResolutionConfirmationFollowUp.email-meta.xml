Hello {!Case.Contact},

I wanted to confirm that the resolution offered in case number {!Case.CaseNumber}  with respect to {!Case.ProductGroup__c} was indeed what you needed to resolve your inquiry.  If no response is received within the next 24 hours the case will be archived with the assumption that the inquiry is resolved.

Please note that if you wish to continue working this issue you can contact S&amp;P Global Customer Care to reactivate this case at your convenience by providing the case number in the header of this email.
