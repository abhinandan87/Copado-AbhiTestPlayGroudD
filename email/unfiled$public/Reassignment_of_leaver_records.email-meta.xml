    <textOnly>Dear ,

We received a request to perform the exit proceedings of your direct &apos;leaver&apos;s name&apos; for all the matters related to Salesforce.

&apos;Leaver&apos;s name&apos; has few Leads/Opportunities/Contracts/Cases/Accounts/Campaigns assigned to him/her(attached).

Kindly specify to whom should we assign the ownership of those records.

Let us know if you have any further queries.

Regards,
