As you may have read, the Basel Committee and IOSCO have&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bis.org/press/p190723.htm" rel="noopener" target="_blank">agreed</a>&nbsp;to a one-year extension of the final implementation phase of the margin requirements for non-centrally cleared derivatives. This means implementation for Phase 5 firms will be split, with some entities not falling into scope until September 1, 2021.<br />
<br />
Please view our <a href="http://https://ihsmarkit.com/research-analysis/monitoring-your-initial-margin-exposure.html">summary</a>* of the announced regulatory relief for more information.<br />
<br />
In spite of this temporary relief, we believe that regulatory initial margin is part of a much wider mission to ensure greater efficiency and stability for derivatives markets, and regulators are unlikely to be sympathetic to those who do not use the extra time wisely.&nbsp;Further, we have <a href="http://https://ihsmarkit.com/products/portfolio-valuations-initial-margin.html">solutions</a>&nbsp;to support you and your firm at each phase of your requirements, including threshold monitoring, management of collateral workflow, performance of initial margin calculations and back-testing.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Please let me know if you&#39;d like to schedule some time to discuss your current Initial Margin requirements.<br />
