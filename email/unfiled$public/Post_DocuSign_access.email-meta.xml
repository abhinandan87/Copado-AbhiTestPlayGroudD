    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Good day!

A DocuSign license has been assigned to you.

You must have received an email with a link to activate your Docusign license. Kindly follow the steps mentioned in that email.

Let me know if I can assist you with anything else.

Regards,
{!Case.OwnerFullName}
