    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Good day!
We do not have any Salesforce licenses available now. We are proactively working towards granting you access to the same.

You will receive an email with a link to an online form you must fill in before we grant you access. You will be notified when you are assigned the license.

Thank you for your patience.

Regards,
{!Case.OwnerFullName}
